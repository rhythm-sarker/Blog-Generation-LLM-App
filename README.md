This Project uses Streamlit and LLama 2 for generating blogs based on user input. Here's the description:

Imports: It imports necessary libraries, including Streamlit, LangChain, and CTransformers, to interact with the LLama 2 model.

Define Model Function: The getLLamaresponse function loads a LLama 2 model from a local binary file (llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin) and configures it with parameters like max_new_tokens and temperature.

Prompt Template: It defines a template for generating a blog, specifying the job profile (blog_style), topic (input_text), and word count (no_words).

Generate Response: Using the LangChain PromptTemplate, it formats the prompt and sends it to the model for generating a response.

Streamlit Page Configuration: The page is configured with a title, icon, layout, and header ("Generate Blogs ðŸ¤–").

Input Fields: Users provide a blog topic (input_text), select a writing style (blog_style), and specify the word count (no_words) via a text box and dropdown.

Responsive Layout: Two columns (col1 and col2) are created for input fields to organize the interface cleanly.

Generate Button: A "Generate" button is provided to trigger blog generation when clicked.

Display Blog: When the button is pressed, the blog generated by the model is displayed on the page.

Backend Logic: The script prints the model's response in the console for debugging.

Focus on Flexibility: Supports multiple styles of blogs, including for "Researchers," "Data Scientists," or "Common People."

Interactive Blog Tool: This is a simple, user-friendly application for creating personalized blog content using AI.
